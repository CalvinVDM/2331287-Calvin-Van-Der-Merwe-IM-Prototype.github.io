    <p>
      This is the wireframe for my Homepage its very simple designed i would
      like to add more things and change a few more things but this is the basic
      Prototype design. The heading will be at the top on the right with the
      tabs on the left. I was the tabs to be highlighted in order to show which
      of the tabs are currently activated. i currently added a compliment
      generator just to have fun with the website so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the wireframe for my blog section so far its just the words with
      thier headings on screen. if the parahraph has a sub heading i added it in
      thier as grey. i made all the headings centre aligned.I would also like
      the words to be alit more centred so ythat it is not againts the sides of
      the page and this way i can add a border of some kind to my design.
    </p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <p>
      so far as for style i would like the style to mostly include the color
      blue it is the central color fo rthis webpage so most backgroounds and
      menus will have the color blue im not sure if this will work out as of yet
      but it should, in future refrence i would like to add some sort of border
      with more images on the sidelines that could add to the aethetics of the
      webpage
    </p>

    <img
      src="images/tribalimg1.jpg"
      alt="Tribal designs image 1"
      id="DesignImg"
    />

    <p></p>

    <img
      src="images/tribalimg2.jpg"
      alt="Tribal designs image 2"
      id="DesignImg"
    />

    <p>
      these are tribal designs which i would like to use in the borders of the
      webpage i have not implemented them as of yet but i will in the next
      iteration.
    </p>

    <h2>Side note</h2>

    <p>
      i dont think the background image is great it looks too plain and it looks
      like instead of an image i chose a normal color so i would like to change
      that. I would like to use a different font in the text to make it look
      better. adding borders around the paragraphs sounds like a good idea to
      try.
