    <h2>Overview of Data Visualisation</h2>

    <p>
      What is Data Visualization and what does Chapter 2 Overview of data
      visualization (Li, 2020) by Li, Q tell us about it? The reading tells us
      the history of data visualization dates to the 2nd century AD and those
      ancient societies used them to record and perceive data such as historic
      events and investigate this that they did not understand in the world
      around them. Due to the evolution of technology and the advancement of
      human understanding and recording the way data visualization is
      represented today has changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main representation of this is the computing devices we use today.
      They have the ability of processing and capture data in efficient and
      accurate ways that have vastly aided us in investigation and record
      making. This is seen in the way we use computers for data visualization we
      use them to make graphs that help us represent and compare data if
      efficient ways that show us visually the comparison between sets of data.
      This is seen in line graphs and bar graphs as well as pie charts which are
      examples of the format that we use to store and represent this data. The
      forming and imaging that is created on these graphs are now done by
      computers that help us efficiently input and process the data for
      comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is the definition of Data Visualization? The reading says most
      definitions focus on the connection between data and computing technology
      for it to be processed as visual or audio formats (Li, 2020). Data
      visualization according to the research I’ve done means that the broadest
      sense means the representation of the information using visual elements
      for people to see and interact with using their vision (Tableau, n.d.).
      Using this definition helps one to think of data visualization in a
      broader sense since this does not focus on the computing ability of
      technology to depict data as now using drawing and other visual elements
      become a viable use of data visualization although I would still consider
      the use of digital elements to be the main way of providing data
      visualization in the present.
    </p>

    <p>
      “How do we define Data and Information?” is the next thing discussed in
      the reading. In the reading, the first definition of data is that it is
      raw, unprocessed information that is not recognized as having any meaning.
      I agree with is information because through this definition we understand
      that there are a lot of types of data and that these data types only come
      to have meaning once they are firstly put in context and secondly, they
      are processed. What is further interesting is the fact the data is not
      defined as digital meaning that data is not reliant on computing devices
      to be data, but these computing devices still use data for processing.
      Data can be defined as “Facts that can be analyzed or used to gain
      knowledge or make decisions; information.” (YourDictionary, n.d.).
    </p>

    <p>
      The forms of traditional Data Visualization refer to the formats and
      things we use to store and see data. These forms show how we usually
      represent data in many different visual ways that help us perceive and
      process the data differently. “The common forms for information
      visualization involve Tables, Charts, Trees, Maps, Scatter plots,
      Diagrams, and Graphs, as indicated in the table” (Li, 2020) these
      representations are useful when doing information synthesis and
      visualization meaning that they are used to help sort out factual data and
      number for example. In scientific visualization, they make use of
      different forms of representation that better suit their needs and
      analysis of the data as sometimes data cannot be processed in the same way
      to represent the same things or different things. This means that
      sometimes another form of representation is used to suit the data and make
      the data more digestible and easier for processing. “There are more
      specific forms of data visualization, such as area chart, bar chart,
      bullet graph, Box-and-whisker Plots, Bubble Cloud, Cartogram, Circle View,
      Dot Distribution Map, Gantt Chart, Heat Map, Highlight Table, Histogram,
      Matrix, Network, Polar Area, Radial Tree, Streamgraph, Text Tables,
      Treemap, Wedge Stack Graph, and Word Cloud” (Li, 2020) these are the types
      that are used in scientific visualization.
    </p>

    <h2>Tree graphs</h2>

    <p>
      These are used by showing the root of information meaning where it started
      and how it develops into other things. This can be used for things like
      probability by showing the different routes probability can take
    </p>

    <h2>Maps</h2>

    <p>
      These are forms of digital representation that show use the graphical
      location of things as well as indicate the layout of the land.
    </p>

    <h2>Scatter Plots</h2>

    <p>
      They are used to represent a lot of information and draw a line through
      the dots that each show data of a specific thing the lines represent the
      average between all these plots.
    </p>

    <h2>Charts</h2>

    <p>
      They are 2 dimensional and indicate data usually on access or like a pie
      chart they compare data against other sets of data. The scatter plot above
      represents a chart.
    </p>

    <h2>Tables</h2>

    <p>
      Used to represent many types of data on one thing like how each row shows
      information about one thing and compares it to another row.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are some examples of data Visualization. Each relies on different
      visual aspects to process the data for analysis and research. The reading
      shows us that the way we as humans see things can help us to understand
      and investigate certain things in a better fashion that is more suited to
      our ability to process information. This shows how our brains are faster
      at picking up certain information and processing things better if we lay
      out the information in a certain way. The visualization of this
      information makes it easier to process and understand if we use the data
      and represents it in more digestible ways for our brain as if we were to
      take in the raw information.

    <h2>Critical Reflection - UI and UX</h2>

    <p>
      For noq i think that i have a decent prototpyr for my website the UI(User
      Interface) is decent nothing to complicated as well as the UX(User
      Experience). the navigation is very simple but atleast smooth so people
      are able to treverse the website easily and efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      for now its very basic but i plan to add alot better aethtics to the
      background and menus as well as more images and graphics.
